# self-organizing-maps-SOM
Use self-organzing maps (SOMs) to cluster population cells in Rawanda, by calculating the remoteness and the access to health facilities

## 1) dataset: 
the indicators of remoteness include the distance of centroid of population cells to nearest hospital, to any type of health facility, to capital, to main road, and to any road. 

## 2) method: 
setting seed, trainning SOMs, mapping data onto SOM lattice, apply U-matrix to further cluster the lattice, hierarchical clustering, implementing in R.
